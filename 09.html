    I like no blueberries<br>
    In my ice cream cake<br>
    No air to breathe with that masking tape<br>
    Stop please<br>
    I need a hostage free<br>
    I need a rocket ship<br>
    I need to run from<br>
    I like no blueberries<br>
    In my ice cream cake<br>
    No air to breathe with that masking tape<br>
    Stop please<br>
    I need a hostage free<br>
    I need a rocket ship<br>
    I need to run from<br>
    From you<br>
    I'm just kind of lost<br>
    I fall from you<br>
    I've been looking down a lot<br>
    I fall from yo<br>
    I'm falling way too soft<br>
    I fall from you<br>
    Now tell me when to stop<br>
    Oh no<br>
    Here we go again to this beat<br>
    Oh no<br>
    Tell me why you want to be so sweet<br>
    Tell me what's in your eyes baby<br>
    Red green or blue<br>
    Welcome to the other side<br>
    I keep losing my temper for you<br>
    I love it how you think I'm always this cool<br>
    Excusez moi I think I'm just a fool<br>
    Afraid of what's in your eyes baby<br>
    Red green or blue<br>
    Welcome to the other side<br>
    I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake<br>
    No air to breathe with that masking tape<br>

    I need a rocket ship <br>
    I need to run from<br>
    From you<br>
    I'm just kind of lost<br>
    I fall from you <br>
    I've been looking down a lot<br>
    I fall from you <br>
    I'm falling way too soft <br>
    I fall from you<br>
    She knows it  <br>
    She's in love with me  <br>
    And that's a drug in  <br>
    Dangerous doses <br>
    And I'm <br>
    In love with your poses  <br>
    Can't see straight  <br>
    Can't focus<br>
    Get chills when <br>
    I see your O face  <br>
    You're the coldest  <br>
    Iite cool <br>
    I like no blueberries in my ice cream cake<br>
    No air to breathe with that masking tape <br>

    I'm falling way too soft<br>
    I fall from you<br>
    Now tell me when to stop<br>
    So now you've blown all your covers  <br>
    I got this blue to make you come up <br>
    So when you think it's almost over <br>
    I got this blue to make you come up  <br>
    So now you've blown all your covers   <br>
    Before I forget  <br>
    I got this blue to make you come up  <br>
    So when you think it's almost over  <br>
    Before I lose it<br>
    I got this blue to make you come up<br>
